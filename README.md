*** I'm using markdown "reference style" links for readability.
*** Reference links are enclosed in brackets [ ] instead of parentheses ( ).
*** See the bottom of this document for the declaration of the reference variables

Here's why:
* Can be used in place of modals as a separate component
* A higher order component that wraps the views sent to it in the raw bottom sheet
* Referenced an easy to use raw-bottom-sheet (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-raw-bottom-sheet)
